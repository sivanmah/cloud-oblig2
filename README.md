## temperature measurement of Fridges in a Supermarket

When I used to work at a supermarket, every few hours we had to take the temperature of the freezer to check if it had the right temperature. If temperature was lower than it should be it could lead to the meat, ice-creams and other freezed goods go bad. 

Our censor is in that case placed in a freezer and sends data to our phone/pc if the temperature changes, to higher or lower than the “normal” temperature.

With the help of our sensor we can check the humidity level as well. If the humidity level is high for some reason, 

Ex1) During the summer months due to extrem warm outdoor temperature which can cause the indoor temperature. Solution for this could be that the user adjust the temperature of the room accordingly, after notified with the help of our sensor.
Ex.2) If a customer has forgotten to close the freezer door we are notified with the help of the sensor, for example, if the door is open more than 4 or 5 min.

Our goal is to create a sensor that keeps the products in the freezer fresh by checking the temperature and humidity level each minute and notify us only if the numbers are different than it should be!

We can have a thermostat that measures Celsius (total range: -20 to 50) and humidity (total range: 0 to 100%).
